Under suitable dominant energy conditions (DECs) imposed both on the interior and along the boundary, we prove the corresponding positive mass inequalities under the assumption that the underlying manifold is spin. In the asymptotically flat case, we also prove a rigidity statement when the energy-momentum vector is light-like. Our treatment aims to underline both the common features and the differences between the asymptotically Euclidean and hyperbolic settings, especially regarding the boundary DECs.},

Generalizations of this idea, utilizing level sets of so called spacetime harmonic functions as well as other elliptic equations, are similarly effective in treating geometric inequalities involving the ADM mass. In this paper, we survey recent results in this context, focusing on applications of spacetime harmonic functions to the asymptotically flat and asymptotically hyperbolic versions of the spacetime positive mass theorem, and additionally introduce a new concept of total mass valid in both settings which is encoded in interpolation regions between generic initial data and model geometries. Furthermore, a novel and elementary proof of the positive mass theorem with charge is presented, and the level set approach to the Penrose inequality given by Huisken and Ilmanen is related to the current developments. Lastly, we discuss several open problems.},

In this article I first review certain aspects of this classical theory and then describe how they can be (partially) extended to the setting in which the initial data set carries a non-compact boundary. In this case, lower bounds for the scalar curvature in the interior and for the mean curvature along the boundary both play a key role. Our presentation aims to highlight various rigidity/flexibility phenomena coming from the validity, or lack thereof, of the corresponding positive mass theorems and/or Penrose inequalities.},

  abstract = {The covariant phase space method of Iyer, Lee, Wald, and Zoupas gives an elegant way to understand the Hamiltonian dynamics of Lagrangian field theories without breaking covariance. The original literature however does not systematically treat total derivatives and boundary terms, which has led to some confusion about how exactly to apply the formalism in the presence of boundaries. In particular the original construction of the canonical Hamiltonian relies on the assumed existence of a certain boundary quantity "\$B\$", whose physical interpretation has not been clear. We here give an algorithmic procedure for applying the covariant phase space formalism to field theories with spatial boundaries, from which the term in the Hamiltonian involving \$B\$ emerges naturally. Our procedure also produces an additional boundary term, which was not present in the original literature and which so far has only appeared implicitly in specific examples, and which is already nonvanishing even in general relativity with sufficiently permissive boundary conditions. The only requirement we impose is that at solutions of the equations of motion the action is stationary modulo future/past boundary terms under arbitrary variations obeying the spatial boundary conditions; from this the symplectic structure and the Hamiltonian for any diffeomorphism that preserves the theory are unambiguously constructed. We show in examples that the Hamiltonian so constructed agrees with previous results. We also show that the Poisson bracket on covariant phase space directly coincides with the Peierls bracket, without any need for non-covariant intermediate steps, and we discuss possible implications for the entropy of dynamical black hole horizons.},

In order to prove the inequality, we develop a new approximation scheme for the weak free boundary inverse mean curvature flow, introduced by Marquardt in 2012, and establish the monotonicity of a free boundary version of the Hawking mass. Our result also implies a non-optimal Penrose inequality for asymptotically flat support surfaces in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^3\$ and thus sheds some light on a conjecture made by Huisken.},

  abstract = {We study connections among the ADM mass, positive harmonic functions tending to zero at infinity, and the capacity of the boundary of asymptotically flat \$3\$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature. First we give new formulae that detect the ADM mass via harmonic functions. Then we derive a family of monotone quantities and geometric inequalities if the underlying manifold has simple topology. As an immediate application, we observe several additional proofs of the \$3\$-dimensional Riemannian positive mass theorem. One proof leads to new, sufficient conditions that imply positivity of the mass via \$C\^0\$-geometry of regions separating the boundary and \$\textbackslash infty\$. A special case of such sufficient conditions shows, if a region enclosing the boundary has relative small volume, then the mass is positive. As further applications, we obtain integral identities for the mass-to-capacity ratio. We also promote the inequalities to become equality on spatial Schwarzschild manifolds outside rotationally symmetric spheres. Among other things, we show the mass-to-capacity ratio is always bounded below by one minus the square root of the normalized Willmore functional of the boundary. Prompted by our findings, we carry out a study of manifolds satisfying a constraint on the mass-to-capacity ratio. We point out such manifolds satisfy improved inequalities, their mass has an upper bound depending only on the boundary data, there are no closed minimal surfaces enclosing the boundary, and these manifolds include static extensions in the context of the Bartnik quasi-local mass.},
